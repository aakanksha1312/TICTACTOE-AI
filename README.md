Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI using Minimax algorithm
# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against an AI using the Minimax algorithm. The AI makes optimal moves to try and win, and you can test your strategy by playing against it!

## Features:
- Play against the AI.
- AI uses the **Minimax Algorithm** to make the best moves.
- The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (draw).

## How to Play:
1. You are `X` and the AI is `O`.
2. The game will ask for your move (row and column in 0-based index).
3. After your move, the AI will automatically take its turn.
4. The game continues until either:
   - **You win**, 
   - **AI wins**, 
   - or it's a **draw**.
